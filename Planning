This is a basic plan so that if in case i forget what I planned rite now ... which seems sensible to me for now.

1) Compression Modules.
2) Socket Connections
3) FTP over sockets
4) Configure Openstack
5) Finish SaaS and PaaS communication protocol.
6) Merge into the cloud.
7) Add web interface.
8) FInish with testing.
9) Add Delta Compression algorithm.
10) Create custom java - zip program to compress the folders.
11) Add support for windows.
