This is a basic plan so that if in case i forget what I planned rite now ... which seems sensible to me for now.

1) [] Compression Modules.
2) [] Socket Connections
3) [] FTP over sockets
4) [] Configure Openstack
5) [] Finish SaaS and PaaS communication protocol.
6) [] Merge into the cloud.
7) [] Add web interface.
8) [] FInish with testing.
9) [] Add Delta Compression algorithm.
10) [] Create custom java - zip program to compress the folders.
11) [] Windows support is not going to be the feature for the project under the mapped timelies ... 
Add support for windows ...
